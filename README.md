# JAVS-tranScripter
## For more knowledge start with Artificial Level
---
## This is on development project  
---

Beta Branch, giving support for string


---
Not a Production line project. Research based project which enables English can be used as Programming.

To Test the Project :- 

\* Download the whole file from github.

\* Extract the zip.

\* Go to the extracted folder.

\* Open a shell and install all python requirements (For linux users use pip3 instead of pip)
```
pip install requirements.txt
```

---
For anaconda users 

\* Open a shell and install all anaconda requirements 
```
conda env create -f environment.yml
```
---



\* To test working of JAVS-tranScripter their is a same file with the zip called "main.ai".

\* On the shell run this command (For linux users use python3 instead of python)
```
python javs.py main.ai
```

\* To generate the python code use "-p"
```
python javs.py main.ai -p
```

\* To generate log "-l"

```
python javs.py main.ai -l
```
---

\* To generate Env words ** don't use any file
```
python javs.py -envWords
```


## Sample input with String 
```
Store 2 in $v1 then add 3 with $v1 and print the result .
Add 3, 5 and $v1 .
Print the result.
Divide result by 4 and the display result.
Store 2 in $v1, the add 5 with $v1.
Print the string 'i am adding 2 with 5 and the result is ' and result .
